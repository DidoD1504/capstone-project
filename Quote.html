        <p> 
        This phrase suggests that while hard work is a reliable 
        path to success and personal growth, dreams alone can be 
        deceptive. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            Hard work is portrayed as something concrete 
            and dependable, yielding results over time, even if the 
            journey is tough. 
        </p>

        <p>
        On the other hand, dreams are often seen
        as aspirations that might not always lead to fulfillment,
        especially if they are not grounded in reality or pursued 
        with the necessary effort.
        </p>

        The message highlights the importance 
        of consistent effort and resilience, implying that hard work will 
        ultimately pay off, while relying solely on dreams might lead to 
        disappointment.
